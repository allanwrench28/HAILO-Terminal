# Migration: HACS Configuration to Add-on Repository

## Issue Summary

The repository was incorrectly configured for HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) distribution. However, **HACS does NOT support add-ons** - it only supports integrations, themes, plugins, and Python scripts.

Home Assistant add-ons must be distributed through **add-on repositories** that users add directly to Home Assistant's Add-on Store.

## How Users Install This Add-on

### Before (Incorrect)
```
1. Open HACS
2. Add custom repository
3. Install through HACS
```
‚ùå This doesn't work for add-ons!

### After (Correct)
```
1. Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Add-on Store
2. ‚ãÆ menu ‚Üí Repositories
3. Add: https://github.com/allanwrench28/HAILO-Terminal
4. Find "Hailo AI Terminal" and install
```
‚úÖ This is the correct way to install add-ons!

## Technical Background

### What HACS Supports
- ‚úÖ Integrations (custom_components)
- ‚úÖ Themes
- ‚úÖ Plugins (Lovelace cards)
- ‚úÖ Python scripts

### What HACS Does NOT Support
- ‚ùå Add-ons
- ‚ùå Add-on repositories

### Why This Matters
- **Add-ons** are containerized applications running alongside Home Assistant
- **Integrations** are Python code extending Home Assistant's core functionality
- They have completely different:
  - Installation methods
  - Distribution channels
  - Repository structures
  - File requirements

## Repository Configuration

### Before
```yaml
# hacs.json
{
  "name": "Hailo AI Terminal",
  "content_in_root": false,
  "filename": "hailo-terminal",
  "homeassistant": "2023.9.0"
}
```

### After
```yaml
# repository.yaml
name: "Hailo AI Terminal Add-on Repository"
description: "AI-powered terminal and resource monitor for Home Assistant with Hailo hardware acceleration"
url: "https://github.com/allanwrench28/HAILO-Terminal"
maintainer: "WrenchWorks3D"
```

## Verification

To verify the changes are correct:

1. ‚úÖ `hacs.json` file removed
2. ‚úÖ `repository.yaml` uses add-on repository format
3. ‚úÖ No misleading HACS installation instructions
4. ‚úÖ Clear notices that this is an add-on, not integration
5. ‚úÖ CI/CD workflow doesn't reference HACS
6. ‚úÖ Documentation explains add-on vs integration difference

## Impact

### For Users
- üéØ Clear, correct installation instructions
- üìö Understanding of add-on vs integration
- ‚úÖ Proper expectations about installation process

### For Repository
- ‚úÖ Correctly configured as add-on repository
- ‚úÖ Follows Home Assistant add-on specifications
- ‚úÖ No misleading HACS references
- ‚úÖ Accurate documentation throughout
