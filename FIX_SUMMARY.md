# Docker Build Fix - Summary

## Problem
The Docker build was failing with the error:
```
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: 
failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/hailo_packages": not found
```

This occurred at line 95 of the Dockerfile when trying to execute:
```dockerfile
COPY hailo_packages/ ./hailo_packages/
```

## Root Cause
The `hailo_packages/` directory did not exist in the repository because:
1. It was listed in `.gitignore` to prevent committing large package files
2. The design pattern expects users to place packages in Home Assistant's `/addons/` folder
3. The `run.sh` script copies packages from `/addons/` at runtime

However, Docker's `COPY` command requires the source directory to exist during the build phase.

## Solution
Created an empty `hailo_packages/` directory with tracking files:

1. **Created `hailo_packages/.gitkeep`** - Empty file to ensure directory is tracked by Git
2. **Created `hailo_packages/README.md`** - Documentation explaining the workflow for users and developers
3. **Updated `.gitignore`** - Modified to allow `.gitkeep` and `README.md` while still ignoring actual package files:
   ```gitignore
   hailo_packages/*
   !hailo_packages/.gitkeep
   !hailo_packages/README.md
   ```
4. **Fixed Dockerfile warning** - Changed `$PYTHONPATH` to `${PYTHONPATH:-}` to avoid undefined variable warning

## Verification
✅ Docker build now successfully executes all COPY commands
✅ The `hailo_packages/` directory is copied during build (contains only `.gitkeep` and `README.md`)
✅ No impact on runtime behavior - packages are still loaded from `/addons/` folder as designed
✅ Users can follow the existing installation guide without changes

## User Workflow (Unchanged)
1. Download Hailo packages from Hailo Developer Zone
2. Access Home Assistant via Samba share (`\\YOUR-HA-IP\addons`)
3. Copy `.deb` and `.whl` files to the `/addons/` folder
4. Install the add-on from the repository
5. Add-on automatically detects and installs packages at startup

## Files Changed
- `.gitignore` - Updated to track placeholder files in `hailo_packages/`
- `addons/hailo-terminal/Dockerfile` - Fixed PYTHONPATH variable reference
- `addons/hailo-terminal/hailo_packages/.gitkeep` - Created
- `addons/hailo-terminal/hailo_packages/README.md` - Created
- `addons/hailo-terminal/README.md` - Updated documentation for clarity

## Testing
Tested with Docker build commands to verify:
- All COPY commands execute successfully
- Directory structure is correct in the built image
- No build-time errors related to missing directories

## Impact
**Before**: Docker build fails immediately when trying to install the add-on
**After**: Docker build succeeds, users can successfully install and use the add-on

This fix maintains backward compatibility and follows Home Assistant add-on best practices.
